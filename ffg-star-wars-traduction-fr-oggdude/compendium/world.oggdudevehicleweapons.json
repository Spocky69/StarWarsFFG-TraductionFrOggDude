			"description": "[H3]Alternating-Fire Concussion Missile Launcher[h3]\n\nThe more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on all manner of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships. Roughly a meter long, a concussion missile employs special warheads, combining a hardened durasteel penetrator that uses kinetic force to pierce through a ship's armor and a shaped high-explosive charge that causes damage through both explosive force and concussive shock. Concussion missiles are primarily anti-fighter weapons, used to quickly deal crippling damage to starfighters and patrol boats, although they perform well against larger targets as well.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]"
